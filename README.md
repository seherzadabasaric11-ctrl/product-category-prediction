#Product Category Prediction 
This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow for predicting product categories based on product data.
#Project Structure
-˙data/˙ - dataset files used for training and testing 
-˙notebooks/˙ - exploratory data analysis and preprocessing 
-˙models/˙ - trained machine learning model (˙.pkl˙)
-˙train_model.py˙ - script for training the model
- ˙predict_category.py˙ - script for predicting product categories
#Workflow
1. Data exploration and analysis were performed in Jupyter Notebook.
2. A machine learning model was trained using Python.
3. The trained model was saved and used for category prediction.
#Tehnologies Used
